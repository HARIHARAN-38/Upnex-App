## Highlights

- Clean, modern Swing UI (FlatLaf) with a top hero bar for search and navigation
- Question feed with filters (New, Hot, Unanswered, Solved)
- Full question details page with tags, author, vote panel, answer list, and related questions
- Rich answer input with validation, character counter, and success feedback
- Voting with shared reusable component and consistent icons across the app
- Profile area and skill management (legacy feature retained)
- MySQL-backed repository layer with schema bootstrap on first run

## Tech Stack

- Language: Java (JDK 21)
- UI: Swing + FlatLaf
- Build: Maven
- Database: MySQL 8.x via MySQL Connector/J
- Testing: JUnit 5

## Getting Started

### 1) Configure the database

Copy the sample config and adjust values as needed (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
Copy-Item config\database.properties.sample config\database.properties -Force
```

Edit `config/database.properties` if your credentials differ (host/port/db/user/password). The app will initialize the schema on first launch using the SQL files under `sql/` and `src/main/resources/db/`.

Create an empty database (if it doesn’t exist yet):

```sql
CREATE DATABASE upnex;
```

### 2) Run the app

```powershell
# build (skip tests while getting started)
mvn -q -DskipTests compile

# launch
mvn -q exec:java
```

The first run will connect to MySQL and apply schema migrations. Logs are written to the `logs/` folder.

### 3) Package a runnable JAR

```powershell
mvn -q -DskipTests package
```

The JAR will be in `target/`. You’ll need the `lib` folder on the classpath for third‑party dependencies.

## Configuration and Environments

- Configuration file: `config/database.properties` (don’t commit secrets).
- Use `config/database.properties.sample` as a starting point. Common keys:
  - `db.host`, `db.port`, `db.name`
  - `db.user`, `db.password`
  - Optional pool settings: `db.pool.min`, `db.pool.max`, `db.pool.timeout`
- The app reads this file on startup and will fail fast with a helpful error if it’s missing or malformed.

## Theme

The application uses a centralized theme in `com.upnext.app.ui.theme.AppTheme`.
See `docs/AppThemePalette.md` for palette and typography.

src/main/resources/db/       # Embedded schema resources
sql/                         # SQL migration scripts (executed on startup)
```

## Database and Migrations

Schema is created/updated on startup. The application runs the numbered SQL scripts in `/sql` and may load embedded resources from `src/main/resources/db/`.

- Example migration scripts:
  - `001_create_users_table.sql`
  - `002_create_skills_table.sql` (legacy)
  - `003_create_subjects_table.sql`
  - `004_create_tags_table.sql`
  - `005_create_questions_table.sql`
  - `006_create_question_tags_table.sql`
  - `007_create_answers_table.sql`
  - `008_add_question_context_and_constraints.sql`
- Voting tables and indices are initialized by repositories if needed; see startup logs.

Minimal schema (conceptual):
- users(id, name, email, password_hash, ...)
- subjects(id, name, ...)
- tags(id, name, ...)
- questions(id, user_id, subject_id, title, content, created_at, upvotes, downvotes, ...)
- question_tags(question_id, tag_id)
- answers(id, question_id, user_id, content, created_at, upvotes, downvotes, ...)
- votes tables (question/answer specific)

## Key Screens & Flows

- SignInScreen – Email/password sign‑in and navigation to Home on success.
- HomeScreen – Three‑column layout (subjects/tags • question feed • profile), with filters.
- AddQuestionScreen – Title, description, tags; input validation and persistence.
- QuestionDetailScreen – Full question view, tags, author, VotePanel, answers list, related questions.
- ProfileScreen / SkillsetScreen – User profile and legacy skill management.

## Architecture Overview

- Presentation (Swing UI):
  - Screens in `ui/screens` (Home, AddQuestion, QuestionDetail, SignIn, Profile).
  - Reusable components in `ui/components` (VotePanel, AnswerInputPanel, HeroBar, QuestionDetailsCard).
- Services (`service/*`): business logic such as search, filtering, and authentication.
- Data (`data/*`): repositories wrap JDBC access via `JdbcConnectionProvider`; `SchemaInitializer` orchestrates migrations.
- Domain (`domain/*`): POJOs representing Questions, Answers, Tags, Subjects, Users, Votes.

Typical flow (post answer):
1) User types in `AnswerInputPanel` → clicks Post.
2) Validation and auth check.
3) Repository persists answer → service updates view model.
4) UI refreshes answers list and resets editor.

Typical flow (vote):
1) Click up/down in `VotePanel`.
2) Repository records/cancels vote and recomputes counts.
3) UI updates net score; state is persisted.

## Components and Reuse

- VotePanel
  - Shared voting widget used in feed cards and detail pages.
  - Uses PNG icons from `src/main/resources/ui/icons/` to ensure consistent rendering.
- AnswerInputPanel
  - Width-constrained editor with counter, disabled/enabled states, and right-aligned Post button.
- QuestionDetailsCard
  - Sidebar metadata (subject, tags, author/date).
- HeroBar
  - Global search, breadcrumbs, and session actions.

## Logging and Diagnostics

- Logs are written to `logs/` (e.g., `logs/upnext.log`).
- On startup you’ll see DB connection info, applied migrations, and repository initialization.
- Include the last 100–200 lines of `logs/upnext.log` in bug reports.

## Testing

```powershell
mvn -q test
```

See `docs/TestPlan.md` for additional notes.

Outputs:
- Unit and integration test reports: `target/surefire-reports/`
- Compiled test classes: `target/test-classes/`

## Theming, Icons, and UI Customization

- Theme palette and typography live in `ui/theme/AppTheme` (see `docs/AppThemePalette.md`).
- Up/down vote icons are in `src/main/resources/ui/icons/` (`upvote.png`, `downvote.png`).
  - Icon sizing constants exist in `VotePanel` and `QuestionCard` for HiDPI tuning.
- Standard spacing and paddings are centralized via AppTheme constants and BoxLayout helpers.

## Documentation

- `docs/TestPlan.md` – Test notes and procedures
- `docs/AppThemePalette.md` – Theme palette and typography
- `docs/SkillsUserGuide.md` – Legacy skills feature
- `docs/*Step*_Summary.md` – Iterative design and engineering notes

## Troubleshooting

- DB connection errors: verify `config/database.properties` and that the `upnex` DB exists.
- Tables missing: check logs; the schema is created at startup from `sql/`.
- Icons look blurry on HiDPI: adjust icon size constants in `VotePanel`/`QuestionCard`.

## Contributing and Code Style

- Branch naming: `feature/<short-topic>`, `fix/<short-issue>`, `docs/<short-topic>`.
- Keep PRs focused and include:
  - What changed (UI/DB/services), screenshots if UI changes.
  - Any migration impacts and rollback notes.
- Java style:
  - Prefer meaningful names, avoid long methods, keep Swing EDT rules in mind.
  - Use `final` for fields where practical, and encapsulate JDBC access in repositories.
