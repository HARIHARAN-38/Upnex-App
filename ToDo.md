create a run.bat file that runs all  schema, the schema execution should be proper like a verifier it checks for tables if it doesnt exist it skips if exist it skips and says verified compiles and stores class file in proper bin. first compile using normal javac meithd and run using that if it failed use maven. everytime the script runs it should properly clear old classes and caches and create new ones.
